Recover lost sales by automatically capturing and managing abandoned shopping carts. This plugin provides a complete solution for cart recovery with powerful automation capabilities.

## How It Works

When customers add products to their cart but leave without completing the purchase, the plugin automatically archives the cart contents. When the customer returns and logs in, their cart is automatically restored - making it easy for them to complete their purchase.

## Automation System

Create sophisticated automation rules to proactively engage customers with abandoned carts:

### Available Conditions
- **Cart Age**: Trigger based on how long a cart has been abandoned
- **Cart Value**: Filter by minimum or maximum cart value
- **Automation Count**: Limit outreach frequency per customer
- **Time Since Last Automation**: Ensure appropriate spacing between messages
- **Customer Tag**: Target specific customer segments
- **Line Item Count**: Filter by number of items in cart

### Available Actions
- **Send Email**: Personalized emails using Shopware mail templates
- **Generate Voucher**: Create individual promotion codes
- **Add/Remove Customer Tag**: Segment customers automatically
- **Set Custom Field**: Store custom data on customer records
